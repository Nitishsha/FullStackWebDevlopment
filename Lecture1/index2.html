    <h4 id="a">PC(Personal computer)</h4>
    <p>A PC can be defined as a small, relatively inexpensive computer designed for an individual user.<br> PCs are
        based on the microprocessor technology that enables manufacturers to put an entire CPU on one chip. Businesses
        use personal computers for word processing, accounting, desktop publishing, and for running spreadsheet and
        database management applications. At home, the most popular use for personal computers is playing games and
        surfing the Internet.

        Although personal computers are designed as single-user systems, these systems are normally linked together to
        form a network. In terms of power, now-a-days high-end models of the Macintosh and PC offer the same computing
        power and graphics capability as low-end workstations by Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Dell.</p>
    <h4 id="b">Workstation</h4>
    <p>Workstation is a computer used for engineering applications (CAD/CAM), desktop publishing, software development,
        and other such types of applications which require a moderate amount of computing power and relatively high
        quality graphics capabilities.

        Workstations generally come with a large, high-resolution graphics screen, large amount of RAM, inbuilt network
        support, and a graphical user interface. Most workstations also have mass storage device such as a disk drive,
        but a special type of workstation, called diskless workstation, comes without a disk drive.

        Common operating systems for workstations are UNIX and Windows NT. Like PC, workstations are also single-user
        computers like PC but are typically linked together to form a local-area network, although they can also be used
        as stand-alone systems.</p>
    <h4 id="c">MiniComputer</h4>
    <p>It is a midsize multi-processing system capable of supporting up to 250 users simultaneously.

    </p>
    <h4 id="d">MainFrame Computer </h4>
    <p>Mainframe is very large in size and is an expensive computer capable of supporting hundreds or even thousands of
        users simultaneously. Mainframe executes many programs concurrently and supports many simultaneous execution of
        programs.</p>
    <h4 id="e">SuperComputer</h4>
    <p>Supercomputers are one of the fastest computers currently available. Supercomputers are very expensive and are
        employed for specialized applications that require immense amount of mathematical calculations (number
        crunching).For example, weather forecasting, scientific simulations, (animated) graphics, fluid dynamic
        calculations, nuclear energy research, electronic design, and analysis of geological data (e.g. in petrochemical
        prospecting).</p>
